# Skoda Karoq vs Volkswagen Tiguan

This is a one-evening project which has started because I was willing to compare two similar cars: the Karoq and the Tiguan.

I used data from lacentrale.fr, extracted Today, the 2026-01-20.

To run locally:
1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `streamlit run app.py`
